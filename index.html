        Artfoundry is a place where creativity is kindeled, stoked, forged, and polished in order to produce an exceptional piece of form and function.  Our primary focus for this creativity is games, currently for the PC and Mac.</p>
        <p>
        Artfoundry was originally formed back in 1997 by two friends and colleagues, David Markowitz and Caven Keith, as a Mac and PC consulting business.  It has since grown in scope to focus on web and multimedia design, 3D animation, and most recently game design.</p>
